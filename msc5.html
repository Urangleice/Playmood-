                        <p>Should tell my boyfriend what I been doin'<br>
                        Been thinkin' of you every time I screw him<br>
                        And if you want me, you gotta put the word in<br>
                        Go tell your girlfriend that I'm your girlfriend</p>

                        <p>Originally, I wouldn't do it (oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
                        But I can't have my heart lookin' stupid<br>
                        I gave niggas a shot and they blew it (ooh, yeah)<br>
                        Initially, I wouldn't do this<br>
                        Hennessy pourin', this shit gettin' fluid<br>
                        We was just friends, but then came in cupid<br>
                        The tension was buildin', we had to pursue it</p>

                        <p>(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        What it's been with us this whole time<br>
                        (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        What if I let your girl find out?<br>
                        (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        What if she was to go tell mine?<br>
                        (Tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        'Cause I don't wanna live a lie, lie, lie</p>

                        <p>Should tell my boyfriend what I been doin'<br>
                        Been thinkin' of you every time I screw him<br>
                        And if you want me, you gotta put the word in<br>
                        Go tell your girlfriend that I'm your girlfriend</p>

                        <p>I'ma play the backend for the meantime<br>
                        Took a break, had to focus on some me time<br>
                        We can keep it low-key for the meantime<br>
                        Had the grip so tight from the inside<br>
                        Got you runnin' back to back, came three times<br>
                        Now I'm kissin' on your neck, that's the sweet spot<br>
                        But if we freakin', I need you to say it<br>
                        It only take one bitch to start hatin'</p>

                        <p>(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        What it's been with us this whole time<br>
                        (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        What if I let your girl find out?<br>
                        (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        What if she was to go tell mine?<br>
                        (Tell 'em, tell 'em)<br>
                        'Cause I don't wanna live a lie, lie, lie</p>

                        <p>Should tell my boyfriend what I been doin'<br>
                        Been thinkin' of you every time I screw him<br>
                        And if you want me, you gotta put the word in<br>
                        Go tell your girlfriend that I'm your girlfriend</p>

                        <p>Should tell my boyfriend what I been doin' (maybe we should tell, doin')<br>
                        Been thinking of you every time I screw him (maybe we should, screw him)<br>
                        And if you want me, you gotta put the word in (oh, oh, maybe we should)<br>
                        Go tell your girlfriend that I'm your girlfriend (oh, oh)</p>
