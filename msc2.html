                            <p>Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together<br>
                            I need the other one to hold you<br>
                            Make you feel<br>
                            Make you feel better</p>

                            <p>It's not a walk in the park to love each other<br>
                            But when our fingers interlock<br>
                            Can't deny<br>
                            Can't deny you're worth it</p>

                            <p>'Cause after all this time<br>
                            I'm still into you</p>

                            <p>I should be over all the butterflies<br>
                            But I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                            And, baby, even on our worst nights<br>
                            I'm into you (I'm into you)</p>

                            <p>Let 'em wonder how we got this far<br>
                            'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all<br>
                            Yeah, after all this time<br>
                            I'm still into you</p>

                            <p>Recount the night that I first met your mother<br>
                            And on the drive back to my house<br>
                            I told you that<br>
                            I told you that I loved ya</p>

                            <p>You felt the weight of the world<br>
                            Fall off your shoulder<br>
                            And to your favorite song<br>
                            We sang along to the start of forever</p>

                            <p>And after all this time<br>

                            Some things just make sense<br>
