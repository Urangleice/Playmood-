                            <p>Something's got a hold of me lately<br>
                            No, I don't know myself anymore<br>
                            Feels like the walls are all closin' in<br>
                            And the devil's knockin' at my door, woah </p>

                            <p>of my mind, how many times<br>
                            Did I tell you I'm no good at bein' alone?<br>
                            Yeah, it's takin' a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep<br>
                            From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know? </p>

                            <p>I lose control<br>
                            When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br>
                            I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br>
                            I lose control<br>
                            When you're not next to me, mmm<br>
                            Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br>
                            You make a mess of me</p>

                            <p>Problematic<br>
                            Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit<br>
                            Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you<br>
                            Yeah, I know I could do it on my own<br>
                            But I want that real full Moon, black magic, and it takes two</p>

                            <p>Problematic<br>
                            Problem is, when I'm with you, I'm an addict<br>
                            And I need some release, my skin in your teeth<br>
                            Can't see the forest through the trees<br>
                            Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh</p>

                            <p>I lose control<br>
                            When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br>
                            I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br>
                            I lose control<br>
                            When you're not next to me, mmm<br>
                            Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br>
                            You make a mess of me, yeah</p>
