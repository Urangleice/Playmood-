                            <p>Don't do love, don't do friends<br>
                            I'm only after success<br>
                            Don't need a relationship<br>
                            I'll never soften my grip</p>

                            <p>Don't want cash, don't want card<br>
                            Want it fast, want it hard<br>
                            Don't need money<br>
                            Don't need fame<br>
                            I just want to make a change</p>

                            <p>I just wanna change, I just wanna change<br>
                            I just wanna change, I just wanna change<br>
                            I just wanna change</p>

                            I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine<br>
                            I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy<br>
                            Oh, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh!</p>

                            <p>One track mind, one track heart<br>
                            If I fail, I'll fall apart<br>
                            Maybe it is all a test<br>
                            Cause I feel like I'm the worst<br>
                            So I always act like I'm the best</p>

                            <p>If you are not very careful<br>
                            Your possessions will possess you<br>
                            TV taught me how to feel<br>
                            Now real life has no appeal</p>

                            <p>It has no appeal, it has no appeal<br>
                            It has no appeal, it has no appeal<br>
                            It has no appeal</p>
